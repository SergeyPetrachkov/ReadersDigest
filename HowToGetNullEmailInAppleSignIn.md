So, Apple Signin is a pretty cool feature. Until you stumble upon the necessity of getting the user's email (even the private relay).

Use "Hide my email" and then go to Apple settings, find your app and disable "Forward to" option. Then you'll get nil in both email field and in jwt token. And there's no way to get that email unless the user enables forwarding again.
